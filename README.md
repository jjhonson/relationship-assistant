# Relationship Assistant

Helps people rediscover, understand, and thoughtfully maintain important personal and professional relationships.

This is an **initial prototype**. The dashboard uses fictional, hard-coded sample data only. A separate **Gmail read-only proof of concept** lives at `/gmail` (see below); no database, payments, or AI providers are used.

## Stack

Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vitest.

## Getting started

Requires Node.js ^22.12.0, ^24.0.0, or >=26.0.0.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:3000
```

## Scripts

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Start dev server |
| `npm run build` / `npm start` | Production build / serve |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | TypeScript check |
| `npm test` | Run unit tests (Vitest) |

## Structure

- `src/app/page.tsx` – "Your Relationships" dashboard
- `src/app/contacts/[id]/page.tsx` – relationship detail page (history, context, recent developments, suggested actions, plan)
- `src/lib/contacts.ts` – fictional sample data and lookups (swap this module to change the data source later)
- `src/lib/format.ts` – date/initials helpers
- `src/components/` – small shared UI components

## Gmail read-only proof of concept

Server-side OAuth (authorization code + PKCE) requesting only `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`. It samples up to 50 messages (metadata only: `From`, `Date`, labels) and shows aggregate counts only (sample size, unread, date range, top sender domains). Email contents are not stored, logged, or sent to any third party.

### Google Cloud setup (manual)

1. In [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) create/select a project and enable the **Gmail API**.
2. Configure the **OAuth consent screen** (External, Testing mode) and add the `gmail.readonly` scope. Add your designated test user(s) under **Test users**.
3. Create **Credentials → OAuth client ID → Web application** with this exact **Authorized redirect URI** (local development):

   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/callback
   ```

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI` (must equal the URI above) and `SESSION_SECRET` (32+ random chars, e.g. `openssl rand -base64 32`). Optionally set `GMAIL_SAMPLE_SIZE` (1–50) to reduce the sample. `.env*` files are git-ignored.
5. `npm run dev`, open <http://localhost:3000/gmail>, and click **Connect Gmail**.

### Credential handling and disconnect

Tokens are kept server-side only in an AES-256-GCM encrypted, `httpOnly` cookie (keyed from `SESSION_SECRET`); they are never rendered to the browser or logged. **Disconnect** deletes that cookie. It does not revoke access at Google: to fully revoke, visit <https://myaccount.google.com/permissions> and remove "Relationship Assistant" (or your OAuth app name).

Cancelled consent, expired/revoked sessions, invalid state, and Gmail API errors show friendly messages without details.
